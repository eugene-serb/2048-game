This is a simple browser 2048-game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, BEM and OOP, and no canvas, no libraries or frameworks. Keyboard, gamepad and touchscreen are supported. Contains dark and light themes.

This project contains:
1. ***index.html*** – is the html markup with game-form;
2. ***./css/game-2048.css*** – are the css style's classes used in this game;
3. ***./css/index.css*** – index of the all css style's classes used in this project;
4. ***index.js*** – are the scripts that do the magic.
